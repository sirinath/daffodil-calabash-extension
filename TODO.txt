* Add scala-library.jar to distribution and rewrite script and
  instructions to launch via Java.  Everyone has Java already
  installed, but not Scala.  It makes the distribution a little bigger
  (on the order of 8MB bigger), but it makes launching it a breeze for
  new users.
* Fix PCAP submodule.
* Improve error reporting if the schema file doesn't exist.
* Use Saxon-JDOM to turn JDOM result from Daffodil directly into
  a Saxon XdmNode, instead of going to string and then parsing
  to XdmNode.
* Add support for following Daffodil options:
  - Send warnings from Daffodil to the Calabash MessageListener.
  - Send trace messages from Daffodil to the Calabash MessageListener.
  - assert-valid - turn on validation support
  - validate-schema - validate the DFDL schema itself
* Replace use of Console with the Calabash MessageListener, or a 
  custom LogWriter.
